	  <p>Hey, hey, hey<br><br>
	  Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains<br>
	  I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind<br>
	  Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream<br>
	  I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind<br><br>
	  Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo<br>
	  The way you move ain't fair, you know!<br>
	  Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight<br><br>
	  Hey, hey, hey<br><br>
	  Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me<br>
	  You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny<br>
	  I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest<br>
	  I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna<br>
	  And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind<br><br>
	  Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo<br>
	  The way you move ain't fair, you know!<br>
	  Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight<br><br>
	  Well you can cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need<br>
	  So gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of<br>
	  You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be<br>
	  I want the world to see you'll be, with me<br><br>
	  Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo<br>
	  The way you move ain't fair, you know!<br>
	  Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight<br><br>
	  Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do<br>
	  Tonight<br>
	  Hey, hey, hey<br>
	  Tonight<br>
	  Hey, hey, hey<br>
	  Tonight<br> </p>
	  <p style="color:black;"> Peter hope you have a great night! If you can see haha. It's a secret message. LOL. </p>
