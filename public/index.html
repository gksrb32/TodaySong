	  <p>
	  Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br>
	  But it's the only thing that I know<br>
	  When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br>
It is the only thing makes us feel alive<br><br>
We keep this love in a photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts are never broken<br>
And time's forever frozen still<br><br>
So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home<br><br>
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>
And it's the only thing that I know, know<br>
I swear it will get easier<br>
Remember that with every piece of you<br>
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br><br>
Hm, we keep this love in this photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts were never broken<br>
And time's forever frozen still<br><br>
So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone<br><br>
And if you hurt me<br>
That's okay baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br><br>
Oh, you can fit me<br>
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br>
Next to your heartbeat where I should be<br>
Keep it deep within your soul<br><br>
And if you hurt me<br>
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go<br><br>
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me<br>
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street<br>
Hearing you whisper through the phone<br>
"Wait for me to come home"<br><br>
